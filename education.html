			<div class="about-course">
				<p>Throughout the first year of my graphic design course, for the coursework aspect I was tasked with rebranding a book cover for a book of my choice, I decided upon 20,000 leagues under the sea not because I like the book but because the existing book covers are very outdated and I thought that there were a lot of potential design ideas to be explored with the theme of deep sea exploration. For the exam aspect of the first year this was based on education therefore I decided to create an A to Z football poster that could be both used as a piece of art and an education tool for children to learn from thier interests.</p>
				<p>The theme for the second year was discord and conflict. I decided that the perfect theme for this was the relationship between the heroes and the villains, therefore I decided to create a superhero magazine, for this I created a few interior pages and the cover. As a lot of existing superhero magazines are aimed at a young audience I attempted to aim mine at an older more sophisticated target market that also have an interest in superheroes. And finally for the exam proportion of my second year the theme was fantasy, to fit this theme I decided to create a series of posters advertising different planets as holidays. Through this I saw the opportunity to bring something I enjoy into the course by using the planets from Star Wars such as Hoth, endor and Tatooine.</p>
