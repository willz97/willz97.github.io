			<div class="about-course">
				<p>Throughout the first year of my graphic design course, I was tasked with rebranding a book cover of my choice for the coursework. I decided upon 20,000 leagues under the sea, not because I like the book but because the existing book covers are very outdated. I saw an opportunity for potential design ideas to be explored with the theme of deep sea exploration.
				The exam aspect of the first year was based on education, therefore I decided to create an A to Z football poster that could be both used as a piece of art or an education tool for children to learn from thier interests.</p>
				<p>The theme for the second year was discord and conflict. I decided that the perfect theme was the relationship between heroes and villains. This led me to decide on creating a superhero magazine. I began with creating a few interior pages and the cover. A lot of existing superhero magazines are aimed at younger audiences, I attempted to aim mine at an older more sophisticated target market that have an interest in superheroes. And finally for the exam proportion of my second year the theme was fantasy, to fit this theme I decided to create a series of posters advertising different planets as holidays. Therefore I took this opportunity to bring something I enjoy into the course. by using elements from the Star Wars universe such as Hoth, Endor and Tatooine.</p>
