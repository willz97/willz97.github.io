			<p class="person-info-para">I have just come to the end of my A-level courses and looking for my first opportunity in the graphic design field. I have built up an excellent portfolio of my design work through my studies and also through projects I have undertaken in my spare time. I completed a successful work placement at Havas Lynx which was an extremely valuable experience and gave me an insight into the demands and day to day work that goes on in a design agency. This experience confirmed my desire to pursue a career in this field. Therefore, I think an apprenticeship placement will be more suited to me, learning and gaining experience in a working environment.</p>
